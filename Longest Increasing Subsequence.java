/* For a given array with N elements, you need to find the length of the longest subsequence from the array such that all the elements of the subsequence are sorted in strictly increasing order.

Strictly Increasing Sequence is when each term in the sequence is larger than the preceding term.

For example:
[1, 2, 3, 4] is a strictly increasing array, while [2, 1, 4, 3] is not.For a given array with N elements, you need to find the length of the longest subsequence from the array such that all the elements of the subsequence are sorted in strictly increasing order.
